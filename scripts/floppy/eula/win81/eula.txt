Microsoft Evaluation Software License Agreement

Windows 8 Enterprise

Thank you for choosing to evaluate Microsoft Windows 8 Enterprise. This is a license agreement
between you and Microsoft Corporation (or, based on where you live, one of its affiliates) that
describes your rights to use the Windows 8 evaluation software. For your convenience, we’ve
organized this agreement into two parts. The first part includes introductory terms phrased in a
question and answer format; the Additional Terms follow and contain greater detail. You should
review the entire agreement, including any linked terms, because all of the terms are important
and together create this contract that applies to you. You can review linked terms by pasting the
forward link into your browser window once the software is running. The Additional Terms contain
a binding arbitration clause and class action waiver. If you live in the United States, these affect
your rights to resolve a dispute with Microsoft, and you should read them carefully.
By accepting this agreement or using the software, you agree to all of these terms and consent to
the transmission of certain information during activation and for Internet---based features of the
software. If you do not accept and comply with these terms, you may not use the software or
features.

How can I use the software? We do not sell our software or your copy of it – we only license it.
Under our license, we grant you the right to install and run that one copy on one computer (the
licensed computer), for use by one person at a time only to demonstrate and internally evaluate
the software, but only if you comply with all the terms of this agreement. Typically, this means you
can install one copy of the software on a computer and then you can use the software on that
computer. The software is not licensed to be used as server software or for commercial hosting ---
so you may not make the software available for simultaneous use by multiple users over a network.
For more information on multiple user scenarios and virtualization, see the Additional Terms.
How long can I use the software? You may use the software for 90 days after the software is
activated. The software will stop running after those 90 days and you may not receive any other
notice. You may not be able to access data used with the software when it stops running.
May I make a backup copy? Yes, you may make a single copy of the software for backup purposes,
and use that backup copy as described below.

How does Internet activation work? The first time you connect to the Internet while using the
software, the software will automatically contact Microsoft or its affiliate to confirm the software
is genuine, and the license is associated with the licensed computer. This process is called
“activation.” Because activation is meant to identify unauthorized changes to the licensing or
activation functions of the software, and to otherwise prevent unlicensed use of the software, you
may not bypass or circumvent activation.

Does the software collect my personal information? If you connect your computer to the Internet,
some features of the software may connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems to
send or receive information, including personal information. You may not always receive a
separate notice when they connect. If you choose to use any of these features, you agree to send 
or receive this information when using that feature. Many of these features can be switched off or
you can choose not to use them.

How do we use your information? Microsoft uses the information it collects through the software
features to upgrade or fix the software and otherwise improve our products and services. In
certain circumstances, we also share it with others. For example, we share error reports with
relevant hardware and software vendors, so that they can use the information to improve how
their products run with Microsoft products. You agree that we may use and disclose the
information as described in our Privacy Statement, at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=190175.
What does this agreement apply to? This agreement applies to the software, the media on which
you received the software, and also any Microsoft updates, supplements, and services for the
software, unless other terms come with them. It also applies to Windows apps that are included
with Windows, which are separate from the software features.

Are there things I’m not allowed to do with the software? Yes. Because the software is licensed,
not sold, Microsoft reserves all rights (such as rights under intellectual property laws) not
expressly granted in this agreement. In particular, this license does not give you any right to, and
you may not: use the software in a live operating environment; use or virtualize features of the
software separately, publish, copy (other than the permitted backup copy), rent, lease, or lend the
software; transfer the software (except as permitted by this agreement), attempt to
circumvent technical protection measures in the software, reverse engineer, decompile, or
disassemble the software, except if the laws where you live permit this even when our agreement
does not. In that case, you may do only what your law allows. When using Internet---based
features or Microsoft Family Safety, you may not use those features in any way that could
interfere with anyone else’s use of them, or to try to gain access to any service, data, account or
network, in an unauthorized manner.

Additional TERMS

1. License Rights and Multi User Scenarios
  a. Computer. In this agreement, “computer” means a hardware system (whether physical or
  virtual) with an internal storage device capable of running the software. A hardware partition or
  blade is considered to be a computer. The software is licensed to run on up to two processors on
  the licensed computer.
  
  b. Multiple versions. The software includes multiple versions (such as 32---bit and 64---bit versions),
  and you may install only one of those versions.
  
  c. Multiple or pooled connections. Hardware or software you use to multiplex or pool connections,
  or reduce the number of devices or users that access or use the software does not reduce the
  number of licenses you need. You may only use such hardware or software if you have a license for
  each copy of the software you are using.
  
  d. Device connections. You may allow up to 20 other devices to access the software installed on
  the licensed computer for the purpose of using file services, print services, Internet information
  services, and Internet connection sharing and telephony services on the licensed computer. You 
  may allow any number of devices to access the software on the licensed computer to synchronize
  data between devices. This section does not mean, however, that you have the right to install the
  software, or use the primary function of the software (other than the features listed in this section)
  on any of these other devices.
  
  e. Client Hyper---V. You may use the Client Hyper---V technology in the software to create a virtual
  instance of this or other software, but only if the software you are creating the virtual instance of
  permits you to do that.
  
  f. Use in a virtualized environment. If you use virtualization software, including Client Hyper---V, to
  create one or more virtual computers on a single computer hardware system, each virtual
  computer, and the physical computer, is considered a separate computer for purposes of this
  agreement. This license allows you to install only one copy of the software for use on one computer,
  whether that computer is physical or virtual. If you want to use the software on more than one
  virtual computer, you must obtain separate copies of the software and a separate license for each
  copy. Content protected by digital rights management technology or other full---volume disk drive
  encryption technology may be less secure in a virtualized environment.
  
  g. Remote access. The software contains Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance technologies
  that enable the software or applications installed on the licensed computer to be accessed remotely
  from other devices.
  
    • Remote Desktop. Remote Desktop or similar technologies is licensed for a single user,
    who is either accessing that software from a local pc, or remotely. For this agreement,
    you are the licensed single user. You may access the software running on this licensed
    host pc from another device, by using Remote Desktop. Other users, one at a time, may
    access the licensed software running on this host pc, from any device using Remote
    Desktop, but only if the remote device is separately licensed to run an edition of Windows
    8 or Windows RT.
    
    • Remote Assistance. You may use Remote Assistance or similar technologies to share an
    active session without obtaining any additional licenses for the software. Remote
    Assistance allows one user to directly connect to another user’s computer, usually to
    correct problems.
    
2. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

a. Application. This Section 2 applies to any dispute except it does not include A Dispute relating to
the enforcement or VALIDITY of your, Microsoft’s, or either of our licensors’ intellectual property
rights. Dispute means any dispute, action, or other controversy between you and Microsoft
concerning the software (including its price) or this agreement, whether in contract, warranty, tort,
statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis.
“Dispute” will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.

b. Notice of dispute. In the event of a dispute, you or Microsoft must give the other a Notice of
Dispute, which is a written statement of the name, address and contact information of the party
giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any Notice of 
Dispute by U.S. Mail to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: LCA ARBITRATION, One Microsoft Way,
Redmond, WA 98052---6399. A form is available at
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=245499. Microsoft will send any Notice of Dispute to you by U.S.
Mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your e---mail address. You and Microsoft will
attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the
Notice of Dispute is sent. After 60 days, you or Microsoft may commence arbitration.

c. Small claims court. You may also litigate any dispute in small claims court in your county of
residence or King County, Washington, if the dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small
claims court. You may litigate in small claims court whether or not you negotiated informally first.

d. Binding arbitration. If you and Microsoft do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation or
in small claims court, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding
arbitration. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all
disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral
arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal
Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.

e. Class action waiver. Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be
conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor Microsoft will seek to have any dispute
heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either
party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be
combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations
or proceedings.

f. Arbitration procedure, costs, fees and incentives. Any arbitration will be conducted by the
American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and in many
cases its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer---Related Disputes. For more information, see
adr.org or call 1---800---778---7879. In a dispute involving $75,000 or less, Microsoft will promptly
reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees. You and Microsoft agree to the
terms governing procedures, fees and incentives at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=245495. To
commence arbitration, submit the form available at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=245497 to the
AAA. You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in King County,
Washington. Microsoft agrees to commence arbitration only in your county of residence.

g. Claims or disputes must be filed within one year. To the extent permitted by law, any claim or
dispute under this agreement to which Section 2 applies must be filed within one year in small
claims court (Section 2.c) or in arbitration (Section 2.d). The one---year period begins when the claim
or dispute first could be filed. If such a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently
barred.
h. Severability. If the class action waiver in Section 2.e is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to
all or some parts of a dispute, then Section 2 (arbitration) will not apply to those parts. Instead,
those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in
arbitration. If any other provision of Section 2 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision
will be severed with the remainder of Section 2 remaining in full force and effect. 

3. CHOICE OF LAW

The laws of the state or country where you live govern all claims and disputes under this
agreement, including breach of contract claims and claims under state consumer protection laws,
unfair competition laws, implied warranty laws, for unjust enrichment, and in tort. If you acquired
the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply. This agreement describes certain
legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or
country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software.
This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not
permit it to do so.

4. ACTIVATION

a. More on how activation works. The software will notify you whether the installed copy of the
software is properly licensed. During activation, the software will send information about the
software and your computer to Microsoft. This information includes the version, language, and
product key of the software, the Internet protocol address of the computer, and information
derived from the hardware configuration of the computer. For more information about activation,
see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=190175. If the licensed computer is connected to the Internet,
the software will automatically connect to Microsoft for activation. You can also activate the
software manually by Internet. In either case, Internet service charges may apply.
b. Re---activation. Some changes to your computer components or the software may require re---
activation of the software.

c. Activation failure. During online activation, if the licensing or activation functions of the software
are found to be counterfeit, improperly licensed, or include unauthorized changes, activation will
fail and the software will attempt to repair itself by replacing any tampered Microsoft software with
genuine Microsoft software. The software will notify you if the installed copy of the software is
improperly licensed or includes unauthorized changes. In addition, you may receive reminders
to obtain a properly licensed copy of the software. You may not be able to obtain certain
updates or upgrades from Microsoft if your copy of the software is found to be improperly licensed.

5. Internet---based FEATURES; privacy

The following software features use Internet protocols, which send to Microsoft (or its suppliers or
service providers) computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of
operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language
code of the computer where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make
the Internet---based features available to you, in accordance with the Windows 8 Privacy
Statement, at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=190175. Some Internet--- based features may be
delivered at a later date via Microsoft’s Windows Update service------if, for example, you acquire an
application that relies on one of those services.

a. Windows Update. If you use the Windows Update service in the software, updates or
downloads to the Windows Update service will be required for proper functioning of the
service, from time to time, and will be downloaded and installed without further notice to
you. 

b. Windows Digital Rights Management technology. Some content owners use Windows
digital rights management technology (WDRM) to protect their copyrights and other
intellectual property, including by disabling the software’s ability to play protected content
if WDRM fails. You agree that Microsoft may include a revocation list with the licenses.

c. Windows Media Player. When you use Windows Media Player, it checks with Microsoft for
compatible online music services in your region and new versions of the player. You may
only use Windows Media Player as described at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=104605.

d. Windows Defender. If turned on, Windows Defender will search your computer for many
types of malicious software, including viruses, worms, bots, rootkits, “spyware”, “adware”
and other potentially unwanted software. If you choose the “recommended” security
settings when you first start using the software, such malware and other potentially
unwanted software rated “high” or “severe” will automatically be removed. This removal
may result in other software on your computer ceasing to work or your breaching a license
to use that software. It is possible that software that is not unwanted may be removed or
disabled. If you use Windows Defender and Windows Update, Windows Defender is
regularly updated through Windows Update.

e. Malicious software removal. If you use Windows Update, at least once each month the
software will scan for and remove from your computer the malware listed at
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=241725. After the scan completes, a report will be sent to
Microsoft with specific information about malware detected, errors, and other information about
your computer. This information is used to improve the software and other Microsoft products.
You may disable the software’s reporting functionality by following the instructions found at
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=241725.

f. SmartScreen Filter. If enabled, the SmartScreen Filter will check the addresses of webpages
and downloads you attempt to view against a frequently updated list of webpages and
downloads that have been reported to Microsoft as unsafe or suspicious. SmartScreen will
also check downloaded programs that you attempt to run against a list of commonly
downloaded or run programs to help you make more informed trust decisions. More
information can be found by visiting the Internet Explorer Privacy Statement
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=239590. By enabling SmartScreen in either Windows or
Internet Explorer, you consent to this feature, and you agree to use the SmartScreen Filter
only in conjunction with Windows or Internet Explorer. You may not, either manually or by
enabling or authorizing any software or service, copy, display, distribute, collect or store
any data provided by the SmartScreen Filter.

g. IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal service (Teredo). Each time you start
your licensed computer, Teredo will attempt to locate a public Internet Protocol version 6
(IPv6) service on the Internet. This occurs automatically when your licensed computer is
connected to a public or private network, but does not occur on managed networks such
as enterprise domains. If you use a program that requires Teredo to use IPv6 connectivity,
or if you configure your firewall to always enable IPv6 connectivity, then Teredo will 
periodically contact the Microsoft Teredo service over the Internet. The only information
sent to Microsoft is standard computer information and the name of the service requested
(for example teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com). The information sent from your computer by
Teredo is used to determine if your computer is connected to the Internet and if it can
locate a public IPv6 service. Once the service is located, information is sent to maintain a
connection with the IPv6 service.

h. Plug and Play and Plug and Play Extensions. Your computer may not have the drivers
needed to communicate with hardware that you connect to your computer. If so, the
update feature of the software can obtain and install the correct driver on your computer.
An administrator can disable this update feature.

i. Digital certificates. The software uses digital certificates to confirm the identity of Internet
users sending X.509 standard encrypted information, to digitally sign files and macros, and
to verify the integrity and origin of file contents. The software may retrieve and update
certificates, certificate revocation lists, and the list of trusted certification authorities, over
the Internet.

j. Network awareness. This feature determines whether a system is connected to a network
by either passive monitoring of network traffic or active DNS or HTTP queries. The query
transfers only standard TCP/IP or DNS information for routing purposes. You can switch off
the active query feature through a registry setting.
k. Accelerators. When you click on or move your mouse over an Accelerator in Internet
Explorer, any of the following may be sent to the applicable service provider (which may
not be Microsoft): the title and full web address or URL of the current webpage, standard
computer information, and any content you have selected. For more information, see
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=239590.

l. Search provider update. The software will download an update to the data on your
computer about search providers. This update upgrades your providers with the latest
features, such as new icons or search suggestions. This is a one---time update, but the
software will try to perform the update several times if it does not successfully download
the update.
For more information, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=239590.

m. Cookies. If you choose to use online features in the software, such as online Help and
Support, cookies may be set. To learn how to block, control and delete cookies, please read
the cookies section of the privacy statement at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=74170.
n. Windows Store. In addition to the terms of this agreement for Internet based features, you
may only use the Windows Store under the terms available at
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=246694. Those terms also contain information about Windows
Notification Service. Windows apps or any preinstalled apps in your Start may use Windows
Notification Service. You agree that we may send you notifications as described in the Windows 8
Privacy Statement and Windows Store terms of service. 

6. WINDOWS Apps

Windows apps (such as Mail, Messaging, Calendar and People) are apps that are developed by
Microsoft, included with Windows, and licensed to you under this agreement. You can access each
Windows app from its corresponding tile in Start. Some of the Windows apps provide an access
point to online services, and the use of those services is sometimes governed by separate terms and
privacy policies. You can view these terms and policies by looking at the app’s settings. Unless other
terms are displayed to you or presented in the app’s settings, you agree the services that you access
from the Windows apps are governed by the Microsoft Services Agreement at
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=246338, or for Windows apps that access Xbox services, the
xbox.com/legal/livetou. We continuously work to improve the services and we may change the
services at any time. The services may not be available in certain countries. You may choose to
uninstall any Windows app at any time, and you may also choose to reinstall any Windows app by
downloading it from the Windows Store. Some Windows apps include advertising. You may choose
to opt out of personalized advertising by visiting choice.live.com.

7. Fonts, Icons, Images, and SoundS

a. Font components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print
content. You may temporarily download the fonts to a printer or other output device to print
content, and you may embed fonts in content only as permitted by the embedding restrictions
in the fonts.

b. Icons, images, and sounds. While the software is running, you may access and use its icons,
images, sounds, and media only from the licensed computer. You may not share the sample
images, sounds and media provided with the software or use them for any other purpose.

8. .NET FRAMEWORK
The software includes one or more components of the .NET Framework, which you may use only
as described at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=66406, if you use the .NET Framework
components to conduct internal benchmark testing.

9. H.264/AVC AND MPEG---4 VISUAL STANDARDS AND VC---1 VIDEO STANDARDS
THIS PRODUCT IS LICENSED UNDER THE AVC, THE VC---1, AND THE MPEG---4 PART 2 VISUAL

STANDARDS”) AND/OR (ii) DECODE AVC, VC---1, AND MPEG---4 PART 2 VIDEO THAT WAS
ENCODED BY A CONSUMER ENGAGED IN A PERSONAL AND NON---COMMERICAL ACTIVITY
AND/OR WAS OBTAINED FROM A VIDEO PROVIDER LICENSED TO PROVIDE SUCH VIDEO. NO
LICENSE IS GRANTED OR SHALL BE IMPLIED FOR ANY OTHER USE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY
BE OBTAINED FROM MPEG LA, L.L.C SEE MPEGLA.COM.

10. ADOBE FLASH PLAYER
The software may include a version of Adobe Flash Player. You agree that your use of the Adobe
Flash Player is governed by the license terms for Adobe Systems Incorporated, at 
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=248532. Adobe and Flash are either registered trademarks or
trademarks of Adobe Systems Incorporated in the United States and/or other countries.

11. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS
You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the
software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further
information, visit microsoft.com/exporting.

12. SUPPORT SERVICES
Because the software is provided “as---is”, Microsoft may not provide support services for it.

13. NO WARRANTY
The software is licensed “as---is” and you bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express
warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local
laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws,
Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
non---infringement.

14. Limitation on and Exclusion of Remedies and Damages
If you have any basis for recovering damages from Microsoft, you can recover only direct damages
up to U.S. $5.00. You may not recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits,
special, indirect, or incidental damages. The damage exclusions and limitations in this agreement
apply even if repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate you for
any losses or if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. Some
states and countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other
damages, so those limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. If your local law allows you to
recover other damages from Microsoft even though we do not, you cannot recover more than U.S.
$5.00, or the amount you paid for the software, whichever is higher.

15. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
