Microsoft Evaluation Software License Terms

Windows 7 Enterprise

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live,
one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the evaluation software named above,
which includes the media on which you received it, if any. Printed---paper license terms, which may
come with the software, may replace or modify any on---screen license terms. The terms also apply
to any Microsoft

• updates,
• supplements,
• Internet---based services, and
• support services for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so,
those terms apply.

By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the
software. As described below, using the software also operates as your consent to the
transmission of certain computer information during activation, validation and for Internet---
based services.

If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below for each license you acquire.

1. OVERVIEW.

a. Software. The software includes desktop operating system software. This software does not
include Windows Live services. Windows Live is a service available from Microsoft under a
separate agreement.

b. License Model. The software is licensed on a per copy per computer basis. A computer is a
physical hardware system with an internal storage device capable of running the software.
A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a separate computer.

2. TERM. The term of this agreement will expire 90 days after the software is activated. You
have the right to use the software under the license terms of this agreement during this
period. The software will stop running 90 days after it is activated. You may not receive
any other notice. You may not be able to access data used with the software when it
stops running.

3. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.

a. One Copy per Computer. You may install one copy of the software on one computer.
That computer is the “licensed computer.”

b. Licensed Computer. You may use the software on up to two processors on the licensed
computer at one time. Unless otherwise provided in these license terms, you may not use
the software on any other computer. 

c. Evaluation. You may use the software only to demonstrate and internally evaluate it. You
may not use the software for commercial purposes. You may not use the software in a live
operating environment unless Microsoft permits you to do so under another agreement.

d. Number of Users. Unless otherwise provided in these license terms, only one user may use
the software at a time.

e. Alternative Versions. The software may include more than one version, such as 32---bit and
64---bit. You may install and use only one version at one time.

4. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.

a. Multiplexing. Hardware or software you use to
• pool connections, or
• reduce the number of devices or users that directly access or use the software
(sometimes referred to as “multiplexing” or “pooling”), does not reduce the number of licenses you
need.

b. Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print
content. You may only
• embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and
• temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to print content.

c. Icons, images and sounds. While the software is running, you may use but not share its
icons, images, sounds, and media. The sample images, sounds and media provided with the
software are for your non---commercial use only.

d. Use with Virtualization Technologies. Instead of using the software directly on the licensed
computer, you may install and use the software within only one virtual (or otherwise
emulated) hardware system on the licensed computer. When used in a virtualized
environment, content protected by digital rights management technology, BitLocker or any
full volume disk drive encryption technology may not be as secure as protected
content not in a virtualized environment. You should comply with all domestic and
international laws that apply to such protected content.

e. Storage. You may store one copy of the software on a storage device, such as a network
server. You may use that copy to install the software on any other computer to which a
license has been assigned.

f. Device Connections. You may allow up to 20 other devices to access software installed on
the licensed computer to use only File Services, Print Services, Internet Information Services
and Internet Connection Sharing and Telephony Services.

g. Remote Access Technologies. You may access and use the software installed on the licensed
computer remotely from another device using remote access technologies as follows. 

• Remote Desktop. The single primary user of the licensed computer may access a session
from any other device using Remote Desktop or similar technologies. A “session” means
the experience of interacting with the software, directly or indirectly, through any
combination of input, output and display peripherals. Other users may access a session
from any device using these technologies, if the remote device is separately licensed to run
the software.

• Other Access Technologies. You may use Remote Assistance or similar technologies to
share an active session.

h. Media Center Extender. You may have five Media Center Extender Sessions (or other
software or devices which provide similar functionality for a similar purpose) running at the
same time to display the software user interface or content on other displays or devices.

i. Electronic Programming Guide. If the software includes access to an electronic
programming guide service that displays customized television listings, a separate service
agreement applies to the service. If you do not agree to the terms of the service agreement,
you may continue to use the software, but you will not be able to use the electronic
programming guide service. The service may contain advertising content and related data,
which are received and stored by the software. The service is not available in all areas.
Please consult the software information for instructions on accessing the service
agreement.

j. Related Media Information. If you request related media information as part of your
playback experience, the data provided to you may not be in your local language. Some
countries or regions have laws and regulations which may restrict or limit your ability to
access certain types of content.

k. Worldwide Use of the Media Center. Media Center is not designed for use in every country.
For example, although the Media Center information may refer to certain features such as
an electronic programming guide or provide information on how to configure a TV tuner,
these features may not work in your area. Please refer to the Media Center information for
a list of features that may not work in your area.

5. MANDATORY ACTIVATION.
Activation associates the use of the software with a specific computer. During activation, the
software will send information about the software and the computer to Microsoft. This information
includes the version, language and product key of the software, the Internet protocol address of
the computer, and information derived from the hardware configuration of the computer. For more
information, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104609. By using the software, you consent to
the transmission of this information. If properly licensed, you have the right to use the version of
the software installed during the installation process up to the time permitted for activation. Unless
the software is activated, you have no right to use the software after the time permitted for
activation. This is to prevent its unlicensed use. You are not permitted to bypass or circumvent
activation. If the computer is connected to the Internet, you can activate the software manually by
Internet before the time permitted for activation expires. If you do so, Internet service charges may 
apply. Some changes to your computer components or the software may require you to reactivate
the software. The software will remind you to activate it until you do.

6. VALIDATION.

a. Validation verifies that the software has been activated and is properly licensed. It also verifies
that no unauthorized changes have been made to the validation, licensing, or activation functions
of the software. Validation may also check for certain malicious or unauthorized software related
to such unauthorized changes. A validation check confirming that you are properly licensed
permits you to continue to use the software, certain features of the software or to obtain
additional benefits. You are not permitted to circumvent validation. This is to prevent unlicensed
use of the software. For more information, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104610.

b. The software will from time to time perform a validation check of the software. The check may
be initiated by the software or Microsoft. To enable the activation function and validation checks,
the software may from time to time require updates or additional downloads of the validation,
licensing or activation functions of the software. The updates or downloads are required for the
proper functioning of the software and may be downloaded and installed without further notice
to you. During or after a validation check, the software may send information about the software,
the computer and the results of the validation check to Microsoft. This information includes, for
example, the version and product key of the software, any unauthorized changes made to the
validation, licensing or activation functions of the software, any related malicious or unauthorized
software found and the Internet protocol address of the computer. Microsoft does not use the
information to identify or contact you. By using the software, you consent to the transmission of
this information. For more information about validation and what is sent during or after a
validation check, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104611.

c. If, after a validation check, the software is found to be counterfeit, improperly licensed, a non--
-genuine Windows product, or include unauthorized changes, the functionality and experience of
using the software will be affected, for example:

Microsoft may
• repair the software, remove, quarantine or disable any unauthorized changes that may
interfere with the proper use of the software, including circumvention of the activation or
validation functions of the software, or
• check and remove malicious or unauthorized software known to be related to such
unauthorized changes, or
• provide notices that the software is improperly licensed or a non---genuine Windows
product
• and you may
• receive reminders to obtain a properly licensed copy of the software, or
• need to follow Microsoft’s instructions to be licensed to use the software and
reactivate, 
• and you may not be able to
• use or continue to use the software or some of the features of the software, or
• obtain certain updates or upgrades from Microsoft
d. You may only obtain updates or upgrades for the software from Microsoft or authorized
sources. For more information on obtaining updates from authorized sources see
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104612.

7. POTENTIALLY UNWANTED SOFTWARE. If turned on, Windows Defender will search your
computer for “spyware,” “adware” and other potentially unwanted software. If it finds potentially
unwanted software, the software will ask you if you want to ignore, disable (quarantine) or
remove it. Any potentially unwanted software rated “high” or “severe,” will automatically be
removed after scanning unless you change the default setting. Removing or disabling potentially
unwanted software may result in
• other software on your computer ceasing to work, or
• your breaching a license to use other software on your computer.
By using this software, it is possible that you will also remove or disable software that is not
potentially unwanted software.

8. INTERNET---BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet---based services with the software. It
may change or cancel them at any time.
a. Consent for Internet---Based Services. The software features described below and in the
Windows 7 Privacy Statement connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over
the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. In some
cases, you may switch off these features or not use them. For more information about these
features, see the Windows 7 Privacy Statement at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=104604. By
using these features, you consent to the transmission of this information. Microsoft does not
use the information to identify or contact you.
Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the
appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of
operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language
code of the computer where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make
the Internet---based services available to you.

• Plug and Play and Plug and Play Extensions. You may connect new hardware to your
computer, either directly or over a network. Your computer may not have the drivers
needed to communicate with that hardware. If so, the update feature of the software can
obtain the correct driver from Microsoft and install it on your computer. An administrator
can disable this update feature.

• Windows Update. To enable the proper functioning of the Windows Update service in
the software (if you use it), updates or downloads to the Windows Update service will be
required from time to time and downloaded and installed without further notice to you. 

• Web Content Features. Features in the software can retrieve related content from
Microsoft and provide it to you. Examples of these features are clip art, templates, online
training, online assistance and Appshelp. You may choose not to use these web content
features.

• Digital Certificates. The software uses digital certificates. These digital certificates confirm
the identity of Internet users sending X.509 standard encrypted information. They also can
be used to digitally sign files and macros, to verify the integrity and origin of the file
contents. The software retrieves certificates and updates certificate revocation lists over
the Internet, when available.

• Auto Root Update. The Auto Root Update feature updates the list of trusted certificate
authorities. You can switch off the Auto Root Update feature.
• Windows Media Digital Rights Management. Content owners use Windows Media digital
rights management technology (WMDRM) to protect their intellectual property, including
copyrights. This software and third party software use WMDRM to play and copy WMDRM-
--protected content. If the software fails to protect the content, content owners may ask
Microsoft to revoke the software’s ability to use WMDRM to play or copy protected
content. Revocation does not affect other content. When you download licenses for
protected content, you agree that Microsoft may include a revocation list with the licenses.
Content owners may require you to upgrade WMDRM to access their content. Microsoft
software that includes WMDRM will ask for your consent prior to the upgrade. If you
decline an upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade. You
may switch off WMDRM features that access the Internet. When these features are off,
you can still play content for which you have a valid license.

• Windows Media Player. When you use Windows Media Player, it checks with Microsoft for
• compatible online music services in your region; and
• new versions of the player.
For more information, go to go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104605.
• Malicious Software Removal. During setup, if you select “Get important updates for
installation”, the software may check and remove certain malware from your computer.
“Malware” is malicious software. If the software runs, it will remove the Malware listed
and updated at www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830. During a Malware check, a
report will be sent to Microsoft with specific information about
Malware detected, errors, and other information about your computer. This
information is used to improve the software and other Microsoft products and services.
No information included in these reports will be used to identify or contact you. You may
disable the software’s reporting functionality by following the instructions found at
www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830. For more information, read the Windows
Malicious Software Removal Tool privacy statement at
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=113995. 
• Network Awareness. This feature determines whether a system is connected to a network
by either passive monitoring of network traffic or active DNS or HTTP queries. The query
only transfers standard TCP/IP or DNS information for routing purposes. You can switch off
the active query feature through a registry setting.
• Windows Time Service. This service synchronizes with time.windows.com once a week to
provide your computer with the correct time. You can turn this feature off or choose your
preferred time source within the Date and Time Control Panel applet. The connection uses
standard NTP protocol.
• IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal service (Teredo). This feature helps
existing home Internet gateway devices transition to IPv6. IPv6 is next generation Internet
protocol. It helps enable end---to---end connectivity often needed by peer---to--- peer
applications. To do so, each time you start up the software the Teredo client service will
attempt to locate a public Teredo Internet service. It does so by sending a query over the
Internet. This query only transfers standard Domain Name Service information to
determine if your computer is connected to the Internet and can locate a public Teredo
service. If you
• use an application that needs IPv6 connectivity or
• configure your firewall to always enable IPv6 connectivity by default standard Internet
Protocol information will be sent to the Teredo service at Microsoft at regular intervals. No
other information is sent to Microsoft. You can change this default to use non---Microsoft
servers. You can also switch off this feature using a command line utility named “netsh”.
• Accelerators. When you click on or move your mouse over an Accelerator in Internet
Explorer, any of the following may be sent to the service provider:
• the title and full web address or URL of the current webpage,
• standard computer information, and
• any content you have selected.
If you use an Accelerator provided by Microsoft, use of the information sent is subject to the
Microsoft Online Privacy Statement. This statement is available at
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31493. If you use an Accelerator provided by a third party, use of
the information sent will be subject to the third party’s privacy practices.
• Search Suggestions Service. In Internet Explorer, when you type a search query in the
Instant Search box or type a question mark (?) before your search term in the Address bar,
you will see search suggestions as you type (if supported by your search provider).
Everything you type in the Instant Search box or in the Address bar when preceded by a
question mark (?) is sent to your search provider as you type. Also, when you press Enter
or click the Search button, the text in the Instant Search box or Address bar is sent to the
search provider. If you use a Microsoft search provider, use of the information sent is
subject to the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement. This statement is available at
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31493. If you use a third---party search provider, use of
the information sent will be subject to the third party’s privacy practices. You can turn 
search suggestions off at any time. To do so, use Manage Add--- ons under the Tools button
in Internet Explorer. For more information about the search suggestions service, see
go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=128106.
• Consent to Update Infrared Emitter/Receiver. The software may contain technology to
ensure proper functioning of the infrared emitter/receiver device shipped with certain
Media Center---based products. You agree that the software may update the firmware of
this device.
• Media Center Online Promotions. If you use Media Center features of the software to
access Internet---based content or other Internet---based services, such services may
obtain the following information from the software to enable you to receive, accept and
use certain promotional offers:
• certain computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of
operating system and browser you are using, and the name and version of the software
you are using,
• the requested content, and
• the language code of the computer where you installed the software.
• Your use of the Media Center features to connect to those services serves as your consent
to the collection and use of such information.
b. Use of Information. Microsoft may use the computer information, accelerator information,
search suggestions information, error reports, and Malware reports to improve our software and
services. We may also share it with others, such as hardware and software vendors. They may
use the information to improve how their products run with Microsoft software.
c. Misuse of Internet---based Services. You may not use these services in any way that could
harm them or impair anyone else’s use of them. You may not use the services to try to gain
unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means.
